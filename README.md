# viper4android-2.7-strings
2.7 translations

# Instructions
- Copy the values folder to your own repo or somewhere offline and append -[country code] to it
- Strings that don't need translation can be removed
- If a string contains a character combination starting with % e.g. %s or %4$s, it is used to place a word there programmatically, so leave it there. You can move it around to make it fit your grammar
- Create a pull request with your folder + translation
